###  Notes from Jan' 17, 2024 - Wednesday

To learn Angular, turns out you need to know a bit of HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. 

I've heard of those tools before so I think we should be good enough to get going with this.

Let's do this.


1. Need to make sure we have Node installed. `node --version`

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment used for executing JavaScript outside of a web browser. It's used for building back-end services (API) and server-side applications.
Node is shorthand for node.js.

2. Install the latest version of Angular. `npm install -g @angular/cli`

---

`sudo npm install` and `ng serve`
